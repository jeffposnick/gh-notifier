# gh-notifier
Get notifications about [GitHub events](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/#events) in your browser.
Try it at https://jeffy.info/gh-notifier/

## Help
- After logging in via GitHub, toggle notifications on/off for each of your repos.
- The toggle applies to the current browser on the current device. You can enable notifications
on multiple devices by visiting this page from each device.
- Use the "Triggers" button to control which GitHub events will trigger a notification. These
settings apply globally to the GitHub repo itself. If there isn't already a
[Webhook](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/) set up for the repo, adding triggers creates one.

## Requirements
Any web browser that supports [service worker notifications](https://notifications.spec.whatwg.org/#service-worker-api).
As of February 2015, this means [Chrome 42+](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html)
with the "Enable experimental Web Platform features" turned on via
`chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features`.
